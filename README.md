# Mchine Learning Regression Problems
This GitHub repository contains a collection of machine learning problems focused on regression. Regression is a powerful statistical technique used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables, making it a cornerstone of data analysis and prediction. In this repository, you'll find a range of regression problems, from simple linear regression to more complex models like polynomial regression, decision trees, and random forests. Each problem comes with a detailed description, dataset, and Python code implementation that you can use to train and test your own models. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced data scientist, this repository provides an excellent opportunity to hone your regression skills and build a solid foundation in machine learning.
